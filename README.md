This is a brief and perhaps oversimplified estimation of vdw interaction contributed from neighboring atoms to a "Ghost atom".
The position of ghost atom, and xyz file has to be prepared first.
Define a coordination of ghost atom, modify the .py file.
.xyz file name is here~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ for other file, u need to re-write coding here.
The 12-6 equation, u can tune whatever value u want, or even vdw radii.
Caution:
This calculation overlooks the concept of "molecules" "orbital" "dipole" "charge" "bonding", just treat everthing as single atom, which acts simply as a lego.

The original purpose was to estimate the possibility of photoisomerization of single molecules within single crystal,
By generating a 5*5 crystal from cif file into .xyz file, I used it to estimate the repulsion contributed at a single point of molecule,
and see if those having lower vdw repulsion are photoisomerizable, and vice versa.

Feel free to contact if u need further help.
